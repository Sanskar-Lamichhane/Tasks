/* Write a program that takes a number as input and checks if it is positive, negative, or zero or not a number. 


If it is positive, output "The number is positive." 
If it is negative, output "The number is negative." 
If it is zero, output "The number is zero."
If it is not a number, output "The value is not a number"


OUTPUT:
findPositivity(0) -> the number is zero
findPositivity(100) -> the number is positive
findPositivity(-1) -> the number is negative
findPositivity("hello") -> the value is not a number
