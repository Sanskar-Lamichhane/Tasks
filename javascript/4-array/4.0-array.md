Array are used when we have to store multiple values which are similar to each other in a single variable


eg: let us suppose we have muliple members in an organization and we need to store their names
    let member1 = "Aarya"
    let member2 = "Aasha"
    let member3 = "Anisha"
    let member4 = "Amit"
    let member5 = "Anjana"
    let member6 = "Bijay"
    let member7 = "Bikash"


instead of writing our code like this we could use an array instead
let members = ["Aarya", "Aasha", "Anisha", "Amit", "Anjana", "Bijay", "Bikash"]


NOTE: the concept of index is very important while working with array
